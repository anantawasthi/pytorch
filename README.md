# 🚀 My PyTorch Journey

Welcome to my repository documenting my exploration of **PyTorch** for deep learning and machine learning. Over the next few months, I’ll be diving deep into the PyTorch framework as part of my learning experience with the ["PyTorch for Deep Learning & Machine Learning" course by freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_xro1bcAuA).

This repo will include:

- 📝 Notes and experiences
- 💻 Code examples and experiments
- 🧠 Trained models
- 🗃️ Datasets and assets used
- 📈 Visualizations and insights

## 📚 Course Overview

I’m following the excellent free course from freeCodeCamp.org, which covers:

1. Introduction to PyTorch and its ecosystem
2. Building neural networks from scratch
3. Training models for computer vision and NLP tasks
4. Advanced topics like transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and more!

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use This Repository

To get started, clone the repo and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anantawasthi/pytorch.git
cd pytorch
```

Explore the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to see my learning progress and experiments.

## 📈 Visual Progress

I’ll be sharing key insights and visualizations here as I make progress. Stay tuned for some awesome graphs and model performance charts!
